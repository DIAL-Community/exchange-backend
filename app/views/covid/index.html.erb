        COVID-19 has become the greatest public health crisis of our time. The Digital Impact Alliance (DIAL) has developed this online resource to support organizations and governments in their COVID-19 response. Though this tool was originally developed for the evaluation and deployment of open source digital tools, it can also be leveraged specifically to respond to COVID-19 in three areas:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide tools to quickly set up messaging platforms</li>
          <li>Quickly identify software platforms that can be used to support frontline health workers and organizations who are tracking COVID-19 outbreaks​</li>
          <li>Link to other resources developed by partner organizations​</li>
        </ul>

            <p class="pt-2">Governments and organizations need to provide regular information to their constituents. Mobile messaging channels are extremely effective, but can be time-consuming and expensive to set up.</p>
            <p class="pb-2">But DIAL can help. We have developed relationships with several mobile network aggregators around the world. These aggregators have established relationships with mobile network operators and can configure mobile services very quickly and easily. A mobile messaging solution can be established in a matter of hours.</p>
            <p>The DIAL online catalog lists mobile network service integrators that provide mobile service delivery around the world and services offered.</p>

            <p>Select an aggregator to view the details for that provider. The Operator Services section shows which services are available by country and which network operators provide those services.</p>
            <p>For example, if you are looking for Bulk SMS services in Kenya, you can expand the SMS menu and see that these services are offered by this aggregator through Safaricom.​</p>
