It is an important breakthrough in the treatment of several cancers, and further ongoing developments give clinicians and researchers cause for hope. Immunotherapy has a completely different mode of action than traditional cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy (irradiation). Immunotherapy uses the patient's own immune system to attack and kill cancer cells. Several forms of immunotherapy exist, all complex and difficult to explain.

A mobile application which uses CommCare platform (www.dimagi.com) has been built. It integrates Madagascar Ministry of Public Health algorithms, validation checks, job aids, and digital reporting forms. The app has two versions : One version for the community health volunteers (CHV) has modules on family planning, maternal health, child health, growth monitoring,  promotion of healthy behaviors, stock information, referrals, community-based surveillance, and monthly activity reporting. The health centers version has modules on CHV supervision (consultation of CHV reports, calculation of CHV performance score, inventory of available registers on site) and monitoring of referrals made by CHVs (development of e-learning modules is ongoing).  Over 350 users have been trained so far, and are using the app. Over 5,000 users are planned by 2023.","Implemented in 3 regions of Madagascar (Atsinanana, Atsimo Andrefana and Vatovavy Fitovinany)","Adolescent and Youth Health,Civil registration and vital statistics,Infectious diseases (non-vector borne),Injury prevention and management,Newborn and Child Health,Nutrition and metabolic disorders,Vector-borne diseases (not listed under Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs),Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH)",Commcare,"1.2 Delayed reporting of events,1.3 Lack of quality/reliable data,1.5 Lack of access to information or data,1.6 Insufficient utilization of data and information,3.2 Insufficient health worker competence,3.5 Insufficient continuity of care","B.

The HNQIS is an electronic tablet-based application used to improve quality of health services in both the public and private health care sector and effectively manage and reach health impact at scale. HNQIS is composed of 4 modules used by health supervisors to (i) plan supervision visits through a prioritization matrix that takes into account quality scores and patient volume, (ii) assess providers’ quality of health service provision, (iii) improve providers’ quality through tailored feedback, and (iv) monitor quality improvement over time. The HNQIS is in sync with DHIS2 and allows managers to take informed decisions by identifying priority areas to intervene, and to better allocate resources where and when they are most needed.","HNQIS is currently live in 28 countries and its implementation will be covering 35 countries in total by end of 2020:
	Asia and Eastern Europe: Cambodia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Nepal, Vietnam,
	East Africa: Burundi, Ethiopia, Jubaland, Kenya, Puntland, Somaliland, Tanzania, Uganda
	Latin America and the Caribbean: Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Nicaragua

Lack of reliable healthcare information is a neglected hidden killer, contributing massively to avoidable death and suffering as a result of misinformation, indecision, delay, misdiagnosis and poor quality care, especially in low- and middle-income countries. HIFA has 20,000 members (health professionals, librarians, publishers, researchers, policymakers, human rights activists and others) in 180 countries, interacting on six virtual discussion forums in four languages (English, French, Portuguese and Spanish). HIFA works closely with the World Health Organization and is officially endorsed by 400 health and development organisations worldwide.
