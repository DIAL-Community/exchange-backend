Users may avail themselves of one or more services from the organization. Services may be delivered by one or more providers at different points in time. From initial client registration, all services booked, availed of, or cancelled, along with transactional history and status, often need longitudinal tracking to avoid confusion across the multiple service categories, multiple service providers, and multiple locations and schedules that the client may be associated with as they journey through different organizations. Common case management WorkFlow includes capturing client and demographic information, appointment and event scheduling, messaging and reminders, management and prioritization of tasks across multiple cases, and summarizing client case data for reporting. Case managers commonly employ one or more job aids, each facilitating a particular service, and potentially customized according to client attributes.",
