# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

      explanation1: "Despite significant investment, we have not seen true scale in software platforms and we have not seen coordinated investment in products designed to meet the SDGs. Digital investments and implementations are most often siloed by sector, resulting in significant fragmentation and duplication of effort."
      explanation2: "This fragmentation makes it difficult for governments to understand where common products could be used, allowing for a whole-of-government approach to investing in digital infrastructure that can deliver reusable digital services at scale with a greater return on investment."
      explanation3: "This online tool introduces four interrelated layers - providing a step-by-step process allowing organizations to begin to plan enterprise architecture and accelerate progress toward the SDGs."

Using the lens of the SDG target, a donor can navigate to a priority SDG target to see what use cases, workflows, and ICT building blocks map support the progression of that target.  Understanding those associations set the groundwork for donors to see the overlap they have with other donors supporting other SDG targets. The tool demonstrates that a handful of work flows and building blocks can deliver a wide range of SDG targets and corresponding use cases."
