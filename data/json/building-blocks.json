There are four key capabilities necessary to enable better management and use of electronic information so as to facilitate secure storage and the exchange of data between consumers, vendors and other organizations. This data exchange will need to be conducted in ways that safeguard the availability, integrity, confidentiality and accuracy of the information. Access management: Following identification and authentication of users, this ICT Building Blocks controls user access to resources within a system (country, network, enterprise or individual solution) by associating user rights and restrictions with the established identity. Cryptography and digital signatures: An essential part of any communication transmitted over an untrusted or insecure medium, including different types of networks and especially the Internet. Cryptography can serve many purposes, including: • Authentication – proving one’s identity • Privacy/confidentiality – ensuring only the intended message recipient can read the message • Integrity – ensuring that the message has not been altered in transit from the sender to the receiver • Non-repudiation – ensuring neither sender nor receiver cannot deny their actions on completion Logging, auditing and attribution: This provides traceability and documentary evidence of a sequence of actions.
