    description: Malnutrition is one of the leading causes of death in children, especially in the most remote regions of the world. Malnutrition is extremely complex to monitor, as traditional measuring tools are often too expensive, prone to human error, inaccurate, and costly to deploy. Child Growth Monitor (CGM) uses mobile technology (augmented reality and artificial intelligence) to capture body scans of children as anthropometric data to deduce levels and variations in malnutrition. This allows efficient measurement, early diagnosis, and rapid emergency response to the early symptoms and effects of malnutrition.

    description: Many countries experience critical shortages of health workers and struggle to meet the health care needs of their people. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated this problem, making it more difficult for health workers to deliver lifesaving, people-centered care. Effective health workforce management is crucial for countries to address these gaps. Human resources managers and other decision-makers require up-to- date and accurate data on the current number of health workers, where they are deployed, their skill sets, and information on vacant posts and migration. Yet many countries lack this information in a central database, making it difficult to locate employee records or aggregate data for analysis. iHRIS is a free and open source software solution that has been used by ministries of health, district health offices, and health care facilities in over 30 countries to more easily collect, maintain, analyze, and manage health workforce data and resources.

Historically, much of the digital interfacing with instruments has been custom and tightly coupled to its software through point-to-point programming. OpenLabConnect can be used as a generalized solution to bridge the LIS and the laboratory analyzer exchange to mitigate these issues.

At its core, it is a concept dictionary that stores all diagnoses, tests, procedures, drugs, and other general questions and potential answers.
