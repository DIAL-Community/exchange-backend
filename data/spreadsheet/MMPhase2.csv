While Zenysis has not been adapted for COVID in Benin yet, it could be deployed as a Virtual Control Room for COVID-19. Zenysis software can be used to integrate structured data from every available and relevant source, both within and beyond the health sector, into a single unified workspace for decision makers. These workspaces, or -Virtual Control Rooms-, can help significantly enhance situational awareness and disease surveillance and provide decision makers the actionable analytics they need to coordinate containment efforts in a data-driven way.  Supply Chain Management. Using the Zenysis platform, emergency managers can view inventory levels, traditionally managed in separate health facility equipment databases, and make quick decisions to move lifesaving health commodities and medical equipment from low burden to high burden facilities and geographies. To manage stockouts, alerts are created to flag when health facilities start reporting low stock.  Cohort Tracking. The Zenysis cohort tool enables public health professionals to conduct both cohort and cascade analyses on groups of patients by various dimensions over time. These types of analyses are key to understanding the key risk factors for transmission and the medical outcomes of subsets of the affected population. Geospatial Tracking. This functionality can be used to monitor outbreak hotspots, map gaps in availability of key services, and plan the location of new services.  Facility Readiness Scores. Zenysis is able to rapidly integrate and harmonize different versions of master facility registries (MFRs) to create a single source of truth for decision makers. Using this data, Zenysis can calculate composite -COVID-19 readiness- scores that reflect the relative preparedness of a given facility and visualize these on private and/or public dashboards. Contact Tracing. The Zenysis platform can integrate patient-level testing data with immigration and customs data to identify contacts who travelled on planes or who transited through immigration arrival halls with people who have positive for COVID-19. It can also integrate patient-level testing data with ride-hailing app data to identify which drivers transported riders who tested positive for COVID-19.  Zenysis can also integrate flight manifests and ride-hailing app data into third-party contact tracing applications to avoid the need for slow, error prone and non-scalable data entry. Case Management. For each patient or individual record, Zenysis platform users can visualize whom they were in contact with (derived from integrated sources), centralize information on each case (e.g. confirmed/ suspected/exposed); and track each person-s journey through diagnosis, isolation and/or care and treatment to monitor compliance and the need for follow up.","Gates Foundation (BMGF),   Zenysis Technologies",Zenysis,"No, they have not yet contributed","case management, contact tracing, coordination and operations, event based surveillance, risk communication and community engagement, routine surveillance, supply chain, vaccine delivery and planning",No,Proprietary,National,,https://www.zenysis.com/,No,,,,,,Zenysis,,,Yes,"Virtual Control Room for COVID-19.

This first version of mUzima for COVID-19 App primarily focuses on supporting screening, contract tracing and capturing of testing information. The mUzima for COVID-19 application uses forms designed in line guidelines from the World Health Organization. This implementation was spurred by requests from the Ministry of Health in Kenya, and is available for adaptation for other use cases.  The mUzima for COVID application incorporates several key features: Data collection: Forms include individual registration, contact registration, exposure, screening, testing and results forms. Contact tracing: mUzima leverages its to enable recording of contacts for tracing. Historical data review: The health worker can view a COVID-19 patient-s historical data even when offline, with relevant data availed from the Electronic Health record system. Geo-mapping: GPS feature is leveraged for locating individuals primarily for contact-tracing. We currently only leverage mapping features for this purpose, and geo-tracing is done with individual-s consent. Privacy and confidentiality: All data within mUzima is encrypted within the mobile device and exchange with secured electronic record system. Patient data privacy was considered in the development of mUzima for COVID-19 application. All the collected patients- information is stored in OpenMRS database. The first version of mUzima for COVID-19 app is to be implemented  in Kenya and works with Android versions 5.0 to 9.0. mUzima can be downloaded for free from play.google.com.","contact tracing, event based surveillance, diagnostic tools, case management",,,,Unknown,,,Other health workers,50,1,"Computer, Smart Phone","Full offline functionality, intermittent internet required",,"HL7 FHIR, JSON",Yeung,Ada,mUzima,adakyeung@gmail.com,,"Adolescent and Youth Health, Civil registration and vital statistics, Infectious diseases (non-vector borne), Maternal health, Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs), Newborn and Child Health, Non-communicable diseases, Nutrition and metabolic disorders, Other chronic conditions and disabilities, Sexual and reproductive health, Adolescent and Youth Health, Civil registration and vital statistics, Cross cutting, Environmental Health, Humanitarian health, Infectious disease (non-vector borne), Injury prevention and management, Masternal health, Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs), Newborn and Child Health, Non-communicable diseases, Nutrition and metabolic disorders, Other chronic conditions and disabilities, Sexual and reproductive health, Vector-borne diseases (not listed under Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs), Violence, Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), Wellness and Mental Health","Adolescents and communicable diseases, Adolescents and mental health, Adolescents and non-communicable diseases, Adolescents and sexual and reproductive health, Adolescents and violence, Birth events, Death events, Other civil registration and vital statistics, Registration of clients and demographic information, COVID-19, Influenza, Measles, Meningitis, Other hemorrhagic fever (e.g. Lassa fever), Other infectious diseases (non-vector borne), Pneumonia, Polio, Tuberculosis, Birth preparedness, Other maternal health, Postpartum care, Pregnancy/antenatal care, Chagas, Dengue, Dracunculiasis (guinea-worm disease), Echinococcosis, Foodborne trematodiases, Human African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness), Leishmaniases, Leprosy, Lymphatic filariasis, Mycetoma, Onchocerciasis (river blindness), Other neglected tropical diseases, Rabies, Residual spraying, Schistosomiasis (bilharziasis), Soil-transmitted helminthiasis (e.g. whipworm, hookworms, roundworms), Trachoma, Breastfeeding, Child growth and development, Infant/child nutrition and micronutrient deficiency, Other newborn and child health, Postnatal/newborn care, Diet, Malnutrition, Metabolic and endocrine disorders, Micronutrient deficiency, Obesity, Other nutrition and metabolic disorders, Diseases of the digestive system, Diseases of the ear and hearing loss, Diseases of the eye and vision loss (e.g. cataracts, vision loss), Diseases of the kidney and the urinary system, Diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue, Diseases of the nervous system (e.g. epilepsy, cerebral palsy), Diseases of the respiratory system  (e.g. asthma, COPD), Diseases of the skin and subcutaneous tissue (e.g. dermatitis, hair loss), Learning and Developmental Disabilities, Other chronic conditions and disabilities, Contraception/family planning, HIV/AIDS, Human papillomavirus (HPV) and cervical cancer, Other sexual and reproductive health, Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs)",

Community members and health workers (specifically from the National Service of Health Education and Information [SNEIPS] and the Medical Assistance and Emergency Service [SAMU]) can call the alert unit, which operates round-the-clock to report suspected COVID-19 cases. Teleoperators receive the calls and enter the information into the platform, tagging them as an event. Doctors, pharmacists, and dental surgeons validate the events by requesting additional information from the individual who reported the events. Once confirmed, the events become validated alerts. Validated alerts are sent to districts for investigation. If districts confirm the alerts, they become suspected cases that are entered into the platform. ""Daan-Covid"" is integrated with the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (SIMR) system

2,synthesis,Sierra Leone,Breakthrough ACTION Interactive Voice Response,,"Breakthrough ACTION Sierra Leone and its partner Viamo collaborated with the Government of Sierra Leone's COVID-19 response to develop a training for health workers caring for individuals who have or may have coronavirus. The training aims to help address the psychosocial needs of these health workers and their patients, and also covers some basics around coronavirus prevention, PPE, patient care, and rumor management. The training is delivered in Krio over the phone (basic phones are fine) through a series of phone calls using an IVR platform. IVR means the health worker can interact with the recording by selecting answers to quiz questions and receiving the appropriate response. There are six lessons in the entire training, each 5-6 minutes in length, delivered over a two-week period in December 2020. The training also includes a pre- and post-training survey to assess knowledge. After the training is completed, Breakthrough ACTION is coordinating with Last Mile Health to include the training recordings on its COVID-19 classroom app which features existing COVID-19 tools and resources. Technically it could be adapted and scaled for COVID use nationally, however, until Viamo or the government is able to put in place an in-country server, its deployment requires international rates for mobile airtime which is very expensive for widespread use. The tool could be adapted for multiple purposes as many people in Sierra Leone have access to at least a basic cellphone. The content communicated via the tool could be changed for many purposes. The interactive feature allows for it to also be used as a survey for data collection if you wanted to use it for surveillance or reporting purposes. As long as you can gather the phone numbers for the intended audience, you can reach them with whatever information you produce. Because it is audio, individuals who are illiterate or with poor eye sight can participate. By delivering content to people's phones wherever they are, it is a COVID-19-safe way to reach people, it avoids bringing people together in large groups for trainings, and it allows for the implementer to reach more people more quickly and for perhaps less costs (especially with an in-country server which would greatly reduce airtime costs) than perhaps could be reached by organizing in-person trainings. Additionally, with an in-country server, the tool could include a call-back option where the user ""flashes"" a number for free and triggers a call-back.

While not used in South Africa for COVID, Virtual Control Room for COVID-19. Zenysis software can be used to integrate structured data from every available and relevant source, both within and beyond the health sector, into a single unified workspace for decision makers. These workspaces, or -Virtual Control Rooms-, can help significantly enhance situational awareness and disease surveillance and provide decision makers the actionable analytics they need to coordinate containment efforts in a data-driven way.  Supply Chain Management. Using the Zenysis platform, emergency managers can view inventory levels, traditionally managed in separate health facility equipment databases, and make quick decisions to move lifesaving health commodities and medical equipment from low burden to high burden facilities and geographies. To manage stockouts, alerts are created to flag when health facilities start reporting low stock.  Cohort Tracking. The Zenysis cohort tool enables public health professionals to conduct both cohort and cascade analyses on groups of patients by various dimensions over time. These types of analyses are key to understanding the key risk factors for transmission and the medical outcomes of subsets of the affected population. Geospatial Tracking. This functionality can be used to monitor outbreak hotspots, map gaps in availability of key services, and plan the location of new services.  Facility Readiness Scores. Zenysis is able to rapidly integrate and harmonize different versions of master facility registries (MFRs) to create a single source of truth for decision makers. Using this data, Zenysis can calculate composite -COVID-19 readiness- scores that reflect the relative preparedness of a given facility and visualize these on private and/or public dashboards. Contact Tracing. The Zenysis platform can integrate patient-level testing data with immigration and customs data to identify contacts who travelled on planes or who transited through immigration arrival halls with people who have positive for COVID-19. It can also integrate patient-level testing data with ride-hailing app data to identify which drivers transported riders who tested positive for COVID-19.  Zenysis can also integrate flight manifests and ride-hailing app data into third-party contact tracing applications to avoid the need for slow, error prone and non-scalable data entry. Case Management. For each patient or individual record, Zenysis platform users can visualize whom they were in contact with (derived from integrated sources), centralize information on each case (e.g. confirmed/ suspected/exposed); and track each person-s journey through diagnosis, isolation and/or care and treatment to monitor compliance and the need for follow up.",The Global Fund,Zenysis,"No, they have not yet contributed",coordination and operations,No,Proprietary,National,,,No,,,,,,,,,Yes,"Virtual Control Room for COVID-19.

Virtual Control Rooms can integrate and visualize any structured data source including, routine public health data (e.g. DHIS2 data), sentinel surveillance data, EMR and patient-level data, logistics and supply chain data (e.g. LMIS), human resources data and more. This data can then be harmonized with existing data within each Zenysis instance to run routine analytics, oversee contact tracing, run cohort analyses, set alerts, case management, produce weekly COVID surveillance reports, provide public announcements, or accelerate operational decision-making.",Global Fund,"Gavi, MOH, Zenysis","Yes, they are contributing in-kind people or time","coordination and operations, event based surveillance, risk communication and community engagement, routine surveillance, supply chain, vaccine delivery and planning",No,Proprietary,National,,,,,,,,,Zenysis,,,Yes,"Any existing Zenysis instance can be used to integrate structured data from any available and relevant source, both within and beyond the health sector, into a single unified workspace for decision makers addressing COVID-19.

2,synthesis,Zambia,Zambia HMIS (DHIS2 _ Tracker + COVID-19 Module),DHIS2,"District Health Information Software 2 (DHIS2) is an open source, web-based platform, typically used as national health information systems for data management and analysis purposes, for health program monitoring and evaluation, as facility registries and service availability mapping, for logistics management and for mobile tracking of pregnant mothers in rural communities. DHIS2 supports the collection, analysis, visualization, and sharing of both aggregate and individual-level data, including mobile and offline data collection using the DHIS2 Android app. DHIS2 is deployed in over 70 countries. DHIS2 Tracker is an open-source, web-based application that supports data collection, and analysis of transactional or disaggregated data. The core DHIS2 Tracker software development is managed by the Health Information Systems Program (HISP) at the University of Oslo. DHIS2 Tracker is an extension of DHIS2 and should not be confused with DHIS2. In practice, DHIS2 Tracker is used for tracking individual data and can be used in a community or facility setting; DHIS2 is used to track aggregate data, typically at a district-level. The DHIS2 Tracker has been built to work seamlessly with DHIS2. DHIS2 Capture is the mobile component of the DHIS2 platform.  The DHIS2 digital data package for COVID-19 is designed to accelerate case detection, situation reporting, active surveillance and response for COVID-19 in countries. The COVID-19 digital data package includes standard metadata aligned with the WHO-s technical guidance on COVID-19 surveillance and has been adapted to local country context and language in this implementation.","GAVI, Global Fund, North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD)","AOS.Health, Blue Frontier UK Ltd., eSHIFT Partner Network, HISP Uganda/South Africa,sHISP Geneva, MOH","Yes, they are contributing in-kind people or time","case management, contact tracing_, event based surveillance, routine surveillance",Yes,Non protective free and open source software (e.g. Apache),National,,,Yes,,,,,,University of Oslo,"Accelerate case detection, situation reporting, active surveillance and response for COVID-19 .","case management, contact tracing_, event based surveillance_, routine surveillance",Yes,,"coordination and operations_, diagnostic tools_, laboratory systems, one health, points of entry_, supply chain, vaccine delivery and planning","DHIS2, GAVI, Global Fund, MOH",MOH,,National,,,,,,Computer,"Full offline functionality, intermittent internet required",Facility Registry,"ADX - Aggregate Data Exchange, GML - Geography Markup Language, ICD-10, JSON, LOINC",Krafft,Max,HISP University of Oslo / DHIS2,max@dhis2.org,,,,
