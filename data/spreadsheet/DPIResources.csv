Infrastructure",Playbook,"Camridge Judge Business School
",University of Cambridge,https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cigb-nationwide-digital-public-infrastructure-2023.pdf,"This playbook advocates for nationwide digital infrastructure, such as digital identity and payment systems, as transformative tools for development. It argues that traditional top-down approaches to development have often failed to reach the informal sector, hindering progress. Digital infrastructure offers a 'third way', empowering individuals and firms by formalizing property rights and facilitating access to finance and markets. The Indian model, characterized by public-private partnership, has successfully leveraged digital tools to integrate the informal sector into the formal economy, fostering social cohesion and economic empowerment. This approach, available to all countries, holds the potential to drive inclusive prosperity by bridging digital divides and empowering marginalized communities."
