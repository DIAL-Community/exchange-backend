So far, 444,234 successful calls have been made to citizens. In 2017, Viamo developed a project with HNI and UNICEF in DRC to increase the general populationesknowledge of yellow fever vector control and improve WASH practices (especially regarding yellowfever and cholera) at the household and community level. We worked to create and launch two sets ofmessages; Yellow Fever (10 messages, over 270,000 people reached) and WASH-Cholera (10messages, over 144,000 people reached) for the national 3-2-1 Service, known locally as 42502.Message timing aligned with the cholera epidemic throughout DRC. A push SMS campaign was alsocoordinated with Vodacom at the height of the outbreak, to 42502 users in Kinshasa (Feb 2018). In animpact evaluation managed by Viamo, _57%_ of respondents reported that after listening to themessages, they improved their knowledge of cholera, and _62% _of respondents reported that afterlistening to the messages, they improved their knowledge of yellow fever. In 2018, Viamo began implementing  Integrated Health Program (IHPs) in the DRC in  2018. Our main activities on these projects include data collection using mobile IVR surveys and customized dashboards; 3-2-1 behavior change communicationon family planning, maternal and child health, and communicable disease prevention; accountability hotlines; targeted stakeholder messaging; a nearly warning system for disease outbreaks; as tock management system; and an appointment management application.

In Ethiopia, the Zenysis platform successfully integrated data from more than 15 fragmented systems for the first time. This includes data from three routine health information systems as well as surveillance data, surveys, supply chain data, financial data,climatological data and more.More than 600 million data points from these systems are now accessible for analysis through a single, easy-to-use platform. The platform has enabled a significant shift from low-resolution (regional-level) analytics to high-resolution (facility-level) analysis anddecision-making. Decision-makers can now access continuously updated performance statistics for all 860+ districts on-demand.  Any existing Zenysis instance can be used to integrate structured data from any available and relevant source, both within and beyond the health sector, into a single unified workspace for decision makers addressing COVID-19. These workspaces, or eVirtual Control Roomse, can help significantly enhance situational awareness and disease surveillance and provide decision makers the actionable analytics they need to coordinate containment efforts in a data-driven way. Within the Virtual Control Room, decision-makers have access to near real-time, high-resolution analytics that help them take and coordinate effective action. These analytics are available through easy-to-use visualizations and dashboards that can also be shared to keep the public and partner organizations informed of developments. Virtual Control Rooms can integrate and visualize any structured data source including, routine public health data (e.g. DHIS2 data), sentinel surveillance data, EMR and patient-level data, logistics and supply chain data (e.g. LMIS), human resources data and more. This data can then be harmonized with existing data within each Zenysis instance to run routine analytics, oversee contact tracing, run cohort analyses, set alerts, case management, produce weekly COVID surveillance reports, provide public announcements, or accelerate operational decision-makin","Gates Foundation (BMGF),   ","Zenysis, Federal Ministry of Health, Tenly Snow, Claire Cravero",,"coordination and operations _, data analytics, visualizations, and use_, interoperability _",,Proprietary,National,EHDAP is primarily implemented and used at the central level in Ethiopia by Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH) users.

Landscape Review of Electronic Health Records and Interoperability in LMICs",Global,OpenMRS for EMS,OpenMRS,"OpenMRS was designed specifically for low-resource environments. It is a free, highly customizable, electronic health record platform which can be used on most current laptop and mobile devices. The solution leveraged OpenMRSe prepackaged Reference Application 2.9.0 docker image as the base application. The Reference Application builds on the platform and enables the design of a customized medical records system. Using the OpenMRS Platform or Reference Application, countries and organizations can use ready-to-use community modules, develop their own, and build their own customized electronic medical record system to meet their implementation needs.  A COVID-19 data dictionary and a corresponding paper form were developed that included the necessary concepts and questions required by IEMS. These concepts were aligned with the Columbia International eHealth Laboratory (CIEL) dictionary by matching with existing CIEL codes where available. Following code matching, the data dictionary was placed into a format usable by the OpenMRS Initializer module, which served as the primary terminology management tool for ensuring consistent concept metadata across development, testing, and production instances of OpenMRS. Following terminology management, an HTML form was created to mirror the IEMS COVID-19 paper form. This form was incorporated into the data collection interface of OpenMRS to be used by clinicians and staff in the field to support patient records for COVID and Non COVID patients that do not require hospitalization.","Digital Square, COVID-19","Haitian Health Foundation

These workspaces, or eVirtual Control Roomse, can help significantly enhance situational awareness and disease surveillance and provide decision makers the actionable analytics they need to coordinate containment efforts in a data-driven way. Within the Virtual Control Room, decision-makers have access to near real-time, high-resolution analytics that help them take and coordinate effective action. These analytics are available through easy-to-use visualizations and dashboards that can also be shared to keep the public and partner organizations informed of developments. Virtual Control Rooms can integrate and visualize any structured data source including, routine public health data (e.g. DHIS2 data), sentinel surveillance data, EMR and patient-level data, logistics and supply chain data (e.g. LMIS), human resources data and more. This data can then be harmonized with existing data within each Zenysis instance to run routine analytics, oversee contact tracing, run cohort analyses, set alerts, case management, produce weekly COVID surveillance reports, provide public announcements, or accelerate operational decision-making",,"Alliance India

The entire exercise was executed with the help of our core team of researchers, a survey team of about 30 surveyors, four supervisors, and two senior coordinators. We used SurveyCTO for the development, deployment, and monitoring of surveys for the pre-testing of tools, house-listing exercise, and quantitative surveys.

As our focus is on rural areas, we also take into account factors that are of fundamental importance to rural populations, like agricultural seasons and environmental or economic shocks. We are implementing the project in three states of India (Karnataka, Jharkhand, and West Bengal), and we have a similar project in Bangladesh. The survey design, monitoring needs, logistics, and time limitations quite early made the choice of CAPI (computer-assisted personal interviewing) a given. Some examples of how electronic data collection was used and how we saw the advantages:  SurveyCTO is utilized for household surveys, hypothetical games, market surveys, and group discussions. The clear advantage became apparent when we conducted the games. In behavioral economics, simple decision games are played in order to elicit certain preferences, such as time preference, risk aversion, or mutual behaviors. These are simple to play, but tricky in preparation and documentation as many conditional choices are included. In a paper version, an enumerator would jump from question to question depending on the given answer, a process which is often prone to mistakes. However, conditions can simply be coded when using CAPI, virtually eliminating this margin for human error.","German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development,Fiat Panis Foundation.","Centre for Development Research (ZEF), Centre for Development Research (ZEF), SurveyCTO, University of Calcutta, Pravah, Welthungerhilfe, the Veterinary College of Hassan, and the GIZ Green Innovation Centres Project, National Field Service, Bhoomi Sustainable Development Society",,coordination and operations,,,Subnational,"3 states (Karnataka, Jharkhand, and West Bengal)",,yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The CCP has been implemented across 37 hospitals to train over 200,000 families since inception in 2013  SurveyCTO is the primary tool that we use for collecting data across our organization for multiple projects and training programs. One critical type of data that we collect is health outcomes data of patients and their families following major hospitalizations. Weere using SurveyCTO to routinely monitor post-hospitalization health of over 1200+ patient-families monthly: we conduct interviews with families to find out how the patientes health has been following hospitalization, whether theyeve faced any complications like infections or readmissions, and the success theyeve had in adopting or not adopting key healthy behaviors.

While some of these obstacles, such as the time it takes for the pharmacies to receive payment from UHIP, and the necessity to leave prescriptions with the pharmacy cannot be circumvented, there are other measures that can be taken to reduce the amount of stress on the patient. The patient should not have to travel far in order to have access to much-needed medication, nor should they have to return to their physicianes office for additional copies of their prescriptions. An innovative way to deal with these inconveniences, which has yet to be implemented would be to go digital.

Callers can also play interactive audio games, which are engaging,pathway-based games that allow them to think through decisions on relevant topics. Viamo has partnered with The Accountability Lab in Nepal to address common myths and misconceptions on COVID-19 by providing COVID News messages on our 3-2-1 Service. Viamo has partnered with IFPRI (International Food Policy Research Institute) in Nepal to send messages to farmers on how to manage the effects of Fall ArmyWorm on their crop, as they are unable to disseminate the information in person due to the COVID-19 crisis.  Leveraging existing mobile infrastructure and local partnerships, Viamoes mobile solutions can be mobilized quickly and scaled nationally within weeks, making these solutions uniquely effective in responding to dangerously evolving health emergencies such as COVID-19. Viamo is currently in discussions with partners to coordinate efforts to share critical information on prevention and treatment, curb panic, and correct rapidly spreading misinformation regarding the outbreak. Existing technology integrations in-country can be used to reach any mobile subscriber on any network to disseminate crucial information throughout the targeted regions and to vulnerable populations.

Can connect to other eTB managers or M&E systems. Can also send targeted SMS alerts to facility managers, health officers and suppliers. Implementation site: FMoH Directorates. Collects and transmits a wealth of electronic diagnostic and operational  data directly from diagnostic instruments. GxAlert, based on the Aspect software platform and designed to work with the Cepheid's GeneXperte, has grown to cover 35 countries and more than 750 laboratories. Challenge TB funded SystemOne to connect its diagnostic connectivity solution GxAlert to 39 GeneXpert instruments. GxAlert enabled a solution to address the following gaps: 1) Device management, monitoring and reporting, 2) Calibration, maintenance and procurement planning, 3) Lab technologist capacity, availability and training, 4) Real-time results notification to respective stakeholders including rapid case notifications for all positive results to all relevant healthcare officers, Inventory management and notifications to reduce stockouts and expire  Collects and transmits a wealth of electronic diagnostic and operational  data directly from diagnostic instruments. In Nigeria, SystemOnees connectivity platform GxAlert is being used to reduce the turnaround time for reporting of GeneXpert Rifampicin resistant TB cases to the TB government supervisor, state program manager and national program enrollment officer through automated SMS alerts. Since implementation of the GxAlert SMS system, the proportion of drug-resistant TB patients on treatment has significantly increased from 20% in 2014 to 85% in 2015",Abt Associates,"SystemOne, Abt Associates; FMOH; Cepheid; MSH",,"case management, coordination and operations, laboratory systems, surveillance (rapid response teams, case investigation),",,Proprietary,National,all 36 states,https://systemone.id/gxalert,yes,INFO@SYSTEMONE.ID,,"2.10.3 Capture diagnostic
